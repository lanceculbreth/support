                <h3>Potential Microdosing Side Effects</h3>
                <p>Microdosed GLP-1 medications are generally well-tolerated with minimal side effects compared to full-strength dosing. Here's what you might experience:</p>
                
                <h4>What to Expect</h4>
                <p>Microdosing is designed to minimize side effects while providing metabolic benefits. The most common side effects, if any, are typically mild and temporary:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mild gastrointestinal effects (nausea, slight stomach discomfort)</li>
                    <li>These typically subside as your body adjusts to the medication</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Benefits You May Notice</h4>
                <p>Many patients report positive changes with microdosing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Better blood sugar control and improved insulin sensitivity</li>
                    <li>Calmer appetite cues (no more all-or-nothing hunger)</li>
                    <li>Less "food noise" - fewer constant thoughts about eating</li>
                    <li>More stable energy throughout the day</li>
                    <li>Fewer fatigue crashes</li>
                    <li>Reduced inflammation and bloating</li>
                    <li>Heart health benefits: Better blood pressure, cholesterol, and overall metabolic function</li>

                <h3>Getting Started with Microdosing</h3>
                <p>WeightWise Sustain uses a microdosing approach to help maintain your weight and support metabolic health. Here's how it works:</p>
                
                <h4>What is Microdosing?</h4>
                <p>Microdosing involves using smaller, precision doses of GLP-1 medications (Semaglutide or Tirzepatide) compared to full-strength weight loss protocols. This approach is specifically designed for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Weight maintenance after reaching your goals</li>
                    <li>Supporting metabolic health and blood sugar stability</li>
                    <li>Minimizing side effects while maintaining benefits</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>How to Get Started</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Complete the WeightWise Sustain intake questionnaire</li>
                    <li>A provider will review your information within 24-48 hours</li>
                    <li>Once approved, your medication will be shipped within 3-5 business days</li>
                    <li>Follow the dosing instructions provided with your medication</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h4>Refill Schedule</h4>
                <p>WeightWise Sustain uses a 45-day refill cadence. You'll receive a refill questionnaire automatically around day 40. Once completed, your provider will review and send in your new prescription.</p>
